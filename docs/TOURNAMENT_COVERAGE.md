## Current Situation (February 2026)

Right now (early February), the only active major tournament is:

## Why No ATP 500/250?

The Odds API team focuses their free tier on **premier events** where:
1. Betting volume is highest
2. Odds are most reliable
3. Bookmaker coverage is best

For full ATP/WTA coverage including 500/250 tournaments, you need:
- The Odds API paid plan ($30-249/month)
- OR a different tennis betting API

## When Will ATP Be Available Again?

ATP coverage will return when the next major tournament starts:
- **Next ATP Tournament**: Dubai Championships (Feb 24, 2026)
- **Next ATP Masters 1000**: Indian Wells (March 4, 2026)

## Summary

✅ **Working as designed** - The free tier covers major tournaments only
✅ **WTA Qatar Open** is correctly showing matches
⏳ **ATP will return** when Dubai/Indian Wells start
❌ **ATP 500/250** won't appear unless you upgrade to paid plan
